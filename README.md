# OLEM'S OS: My Life's New Operating System

A complete rebuild from scratch, replacing broken factory settings with custom-built systems that actually work.

---

## 📋 System Overview

Olem's OS is a comprehensive personal operating system — a framework for systematically replacing default behaviors, thought patterns, and habits with intentionally designed systems that compound over time. It's not self-help; it's system administration for your life.

## 🏗️ Three-Tier Architecture

### TIER 1: UNINSTALL & CLEAR (Remove malware before installing new software)

1. Uninstall Old Programs - Remove system-crashing habits/thoughts
2. Self-Authored Foundation - Build on ground you actually own
3. Attention Economy - Become administrator of your own focus

### TIER 2: CORE SYSTEMS (Install essential architecture)

1. Action Rhythm - Personal operating rhythm: push/pause cycles
2. Courageous Construction - Building despite resistance
3. Systems That Last - Anti-fragile architecture
4. Personal Economics - Resource allocation that compounds

### TIER 3: DAILY OPERATIONS (Build the user interface)

1. Daily Architecture - Scripts that run automatically
2. Relationships From Strength - Network protocols for human connection
3. Legacy Design - What this system builds toward

---

## 🚀 Installation Path (Non-Negotiable)

```
1. START WITH TIER 1 → Can't install new software on corrupted system
2. THEN TIER 2 → Core systems must run before applications  
3. FINALLY TIER 3 → UI is useless without kernel
```

**Warning:** Installation out of sequence will cause system instability.

## 🎯 System Principles

1. **Sovereign Foundation:** Build on ground you own, not rented beliefs
2. **Attention Sovereignty:** Your focus is your highest-value capital
3. **Rhythmic Operation:** Prevent crashes (burnout) and freezes (paralysis)
4. **Courageous Shipping:** Debug in production, not in paralysis
5. **Compounding Design:** Systems that strengthen under stress
6. **Resource Consciousness:** Time, energy, attention, money as system resources

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a personal operating system, but the framework is open for adaptation. If you're building your own version:

1. Fork the repository
2. Customize for your architecture
3. Document your modifications
4. Share what works (and what crashes)

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is not a plug-and-play solution. This is source code for a life. Expect:

- Installation errors
- System crashes during debugging
- Incompatible legacy software
- The need for custom patches

But a system you administer is better than a factory-default life you merely inhabit.
