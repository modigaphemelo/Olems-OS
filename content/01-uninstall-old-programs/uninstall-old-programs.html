                    <p>
                        Your life is currently running dozens of background processes you didn't consciously install. Habits inherited from family. Thought patterns absorbed from culture. Behaviors copied from peers. <strong>These are the malware of existence</strong> - programs that consume your processing power, memory, and battery life without your permission.

                    <p>
                        Uninstall Old Programs is the forensic audit of your current system. It's identifying every running process and asking: <strong>"Does this serve my purpose?"</strong> If the answer is no, it gets uninstalled. Not disabled. Not minimized. <strong>Deleted</strong>.
