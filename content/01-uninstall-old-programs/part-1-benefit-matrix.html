                    <h3>The First Question</h3>
                    <p>When you ask "Does this benefit me?" and the only answer that comes to mind is financial, you've already lost. You're playing a game designed by bankers in a casino that takes more than money.</p>
                    
                    <div class="simple-box">
                        <p>Benefit is a multi-currency system. Money is the least interesting currency. The real wealth is in: <strong>Energy. Focus. Peace. Skill. Relationship depth. Autonomy.</strong></p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Your Benefit Matrix is the personal accounting system that tracks all currencies. Most people have a broken calculator that only adds dollars while subtracting everything else.</p>

                        <div class="characteristic">
                            <h4>Energy Capital</h4>
                            <p>Your daily capacity for focused work, creative output, and meaningful engagement. What fills your tank vs what drains it. The difference between waking refreshed and waking exhausted.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="characteristic">
                            <h4>Attention Reserves</h4>
                            <p>Your ability to sustain deep focus on what matters. The quality of your concentration. Watching soccer for 3 hours trades attention reserves for entertainment - a terrible exchange rate.</p>

                        <div class="characteristic">

                            <p>The absence of anxiety, resentment, and manufactured urgency. The quiet mind that can think clearly. Most modern consumption trades peace for temporary stimulation.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="characteristic">
                            <h4>Skill Equity</h4>
                            <p>Competencies that compound over time. Watching others play soccer builds zero skill equity. Playing soccer builds some. Studying game theory builds more. Creating something teaches most.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="characteristic">
                            <h4>Relationship Depth</h4>
                            <p>Connections that nourish rather than drain. Bonds built on mutual growth rather than shared consumption. Talking about soccer scores vs discussing life philosophy.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="characteristic">
                            <h4>Autonomy Stock</h4>
                            <p>Your freedom from external manipulation. Every hour spent consuming what others produce is an hour not spent producing your own reality. Soccer fandom is renting attention to someone else's achievement.</p>

                        <p>You'll also discover that most rewarding activities - deep work, skill practice, meaningful conversation, creation - have strongly positive scores. They build your capital in multiple currencies simultaneously.</p>
