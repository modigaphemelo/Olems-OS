                    <p>In 1985, Coca-Cola spent millions developing "New Coke." Market research showed people loved it. They launched with massive fanfare.</p>
                    
                    <p>Within weeks: protests, plummeting sales, public outrage.</p>

                        <p>Most companies would have doubled down: "We've invested too much to quit!" Coca-Cola did something radical: <strong>they pulled the product after 79 days.</strong> They brought back "Coca-Cola Classic." Sales skyrocketed to higher levels than before.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Cutting losses isn't defeat - it's <strong>choosing where to fight.</strong> Every minute spent on a failing project is a minute stolen from something that could succeed.</p>

                            <p>Losing $100 feels twice as bad as gaining $100 feels good. We cling to failing investments to avoid "locking in" loss - even if continuing guarantees bigger losses.</p>
