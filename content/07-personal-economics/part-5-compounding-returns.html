                    <h3>The Eighth Wonder of the World</h3>
                    <p>Einstein supposedly called compound interest the eighth wonder of the world. He understood: <strong>things that grow exponentially eventually dwarf everything else</strong>. But compounding doesn't just apply to money. It applies to skills, relationships, health, knowledge—all forms of capital.</p>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <p>
                            <strong>Compounding Returns</strong> is understanding that<br>
                            the most powerful force in personal economics<br>
                            isn't how much you invest, but <strong>how consistently</strong><br>
                            you invest in assets that pay compound interest.<br>
                            Reading 20 pages daily compounds into expertise.<br>
                            Exercising 30 minutes daily compounds into health.<br>
                            Saving 10% monthly compounds into wealth.<br>
                            Small actions, repeated, create exponential results.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Most people chase linear returns (work hour = dollar) while ignoring compound returns (skill today = 10x earning power in 5 years). They optimize for immediate payoff while sacrificing exponential growth.</p>

                            <p><strong>Competence that compounds.</strong> Each hour of practice makes the next hour more effective. Learning to code at 20 compounds for 40 years. Public speaking skill compounds across thousands of presentations. Skills are the ultimate compound asset.</p>
