                    <h3>The Altruism Paradox</h3>
                    <p>Society praises selflessness while systematically draining the selfless. The martyr is celebrated at their funeral but exploited during their life. The "helper" becomes depleted, resentful, and ineffective. There's a fundamental misunderstanding: <strong>you cannot give what you don't have</strong>.</p>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <p>
                            <strong>Strategic Selfishness</strong> is recognizing that<br>
                            putting yourself first isn't selfish—<br>
                            it's <strong>the prerequisite for sustainable contribution</strong>.<br>
                            An empty cup has nothing to pour.<br>
                            A depleted battery can't power others.<br>
                            A bankrupt account can't fund generosity.<br>
                            Fill your cup first, then let it overflow.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This isn't about narcissism or lack of care. It's about understanding that your capacity to help others is directly proportional to your own resource abundance. Strategic selfishness is actually systems-level responsibility.</p>

                            <p><strong>Pouring from an empty cup.</strong> The martyr complex. Saying yes when you mean no. Helping at the expense of your own health, relationships, or growth. This creates resentment, burnout, and ineffective help.</p>

                            <p><strong>Tit-for-tat reciprocity.</strong> Transactional relationships. Keeping score. This prevents exploitation but also prevents the magic of genuine generosity. It's safe but small.</p>
