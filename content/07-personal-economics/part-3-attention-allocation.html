                    <h3>The Attention Economy Reality</h3>
                    <p>We live in the first economy in human history where <strong>attention has been systematically financialized</strong>. Every app, every platform, every media company is farming your attention to sell to advertisers. Your focus isn't just wandering—it's being harvested.</p>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <p>
                            <strong>Attention Allocation</strong> is recognizing that<br>
                            your focus is not a free resource to be spent,<br>
                            but <strong>deployable capital to be invested</strong>.<br>
                            Every minute of attention has an ROI.<br>
                            Every distraction has an opportunity cost.<br>
                            Every notification is a withdrawal request<br>
                            from your cognitive bank account.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Most people treat attention as something that happens to them rather than something they direct. They are passive consumers of their own focus. Attention capitalists are active investors of theirs.</p>

                        <p>Cal Newport's concept of deep work applies directly to attention economics. One hour of uninterrupted, focused attention on a cognitively demanding task produces more value than eight hours of fractured, distracted pseudo-work. The difference isn't just in output—it's in the compound interest of skill development and meaningful accomplishment.</p>
