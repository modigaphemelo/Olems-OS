                    <h3>The Handshake Protocol</h3>
                    <p>In networking, before any data transfer happens, systems perform a handshake: they exchange credentials, establish encryption, agree on protocols, and test the connection. Most human connections skip this entirely—we jump straight to data transfer (intimacy, vulnerability, commitment) without establishing security first.</p>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <p>
                            <strong>Connection Protocols</strong> are the <strong>human handshake</strong>.<br>
                            They establish:<br>
                            What level of access is being requested?<br>
                            What security measures are in place?<br>
                            What protocols will govern this connection?<br>
                            What are the terms of data exchange?<br>
                            No connection without protocol.<br>
                            No data transfer without security.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The default approach is dangerous: we give everyone root access to our emotional core, then wonder why we get hacked. Connection protocols start everyone at firewall-level access, then gradually open ports based on demonstrated trustworthiness.</p>
