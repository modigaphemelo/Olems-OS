                    <h3>The Social Portfolio</h3>
                    <p>Your relationships are your most valuable asset class. They determine your opportunities, your support during challenges, your growth, and your legacy. Yet most people approach relationships reactively—they take what comes. Network building is the <strong>proactive curation of your social ecosystem</strong>.</p>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <p>
                            <strong>Network Building</strong> is <strong>strategic ecosystem design</strong>.<br>
                            It's moving from random connections<br>
                            to intentional relationships.<br>
                            From transactions ("What can you do for me?")<br>
                            to alliances ("How can we grow together?").<br>
                            From quantity of contacts<br>
                            to quality of connections.<br>
                            Your network determines your net worth.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The old networking model was transactional and manipulative. The new model is relational and mutual. It's not about using people—it's about building ecosystems where everyone grows. It's gardening, not hunting.</p>

                        <p>Before asking for anything, offer value. Not manipulative "fake giving"—genuine contribution. Share a relevant resource. Make an introduction. Offer specific feedback. The best network builders are givers first. They understand that social capital compounds through generosity, not extraction. Give without immediate expectation of return. The return comes through the strengthened network, not direct reciprocity.</p>

                        <p>A well-curated network creates exponential value through connections between connections. You introduce your collaborator to your navigator, and new opportunities emerge. Your explorer connects with another explorer, and they create something new together. The value of a network isn't just the sum of its connections—it's the product of their interactions. A healthy network is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
