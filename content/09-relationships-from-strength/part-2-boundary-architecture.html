                    <h3>The Firewall Fallacy</h3>
                    <p>Most people think of boundaries as walls that keep people out. This is a misunderstanding. In network security, firewalls don't block all traffic—they <strong>intelligently filter traffic</strong>. They allow legitimate connections while blocking threats. They create secure channels for data exchange. Your personal boundaries should function the same way.</p>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <p>
                            <strong>Boundary Architecture</strong> is <strong>intelligent filtering</strong>.<br>
                            It's not about isolation.<br>
                            It's about creating <strong>secure containers</strong><br>
                            where connection can happen safely.<br>
                            What data can pass through?<br>
                            At what times?<br>
                            Under what conditions?<br>
                            With what level of encryption?
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Poor boundary architecture creates two problems: either everything gets through (you're overwhelmed and exploited) or nothing gets through (you're isolated and lonely). Good boundary architecture creates selective permeability: the right things get through to the right people at the right times.</p>
