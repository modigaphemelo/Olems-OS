                    <h3>The Vulnerability Paradox</h3>
                    <p>Vulnerability is essential for deep connection, but indiscriminate vulnerability is dangerous. Sharing your deepest fears with someone untrustworthy isn't brave—it's reckless. The key is <strong>secure sharing</strong>: creating encrypted channels for vulnerability with people who have earned decryption keys.</p>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <p>
                            <strong>Secure Sharing</strong> is <strong>encrypted vulnerability</strong>.<br>
                            It's not about hiding your true self.<br>
                            It's about sharing your true self<br>
                            through <strong>secure channels</strong><br>
                            with <strong>trusted recipients</strong><br>
                            at <strong>appropriate times</strong>.<br>
                            No broadcast vulnerability.<br>
                            No unencrypted secrets.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Most people oscillate between two extremes: oversharing with everyone (emotional spam) or undersharing with anyone (emotional encryption with no keys). Secure sharing is the middle path: deeply authentic sharing through carefully established secure channels.</p>

                <!-- The API Analogy -->
                <section class="article-section">
                    <h3>The Relationship API</h3>
                    <p>In software, an API (Application Programming Interface) defines how systems can communicate safely. It specifies: what data can be requested, in what format, with what authentication, and what will be returned. Your relationships need APIs too.</p>

                    <div class="characteristics">
                        <div class="characteristic">

                            </div>
                            <h4>Authentication Requirements</h4>
                            <p><strong>Who gets access?</strong> What level of trust must be demonstrated? What history of reliable handling of smaller vulnerabilities? No API access without proper credentials.</p>
                        </div>

                            </div>
                            <h4>Request Format</h4>
                            <p><strong>How can vulnerability be requested?</strong> Direct asking vs. prying. Respectful curiosity vs. interrogation. The format matters as much as the content.</p>

                            <p><strong>What data can be shared?</strong> Different API endpoints for different data types: fears endpoint, dreams endpoint, struggles endpoint. Not all data through all endpoints.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h4>Rate Limiting</h4>
                            <p><strong>How much, how often?</strong> Even with authentication, APIs have rate limits. Too many vulnerability requests too quickly can overwhelm the system. Pace matters.</p>
