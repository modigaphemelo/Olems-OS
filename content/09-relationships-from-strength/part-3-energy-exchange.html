                    <h3>The Social Energy Economy</h3>
                    <p>Every relationship is an energy exchange. Some relationships give you energy (assets). Some relationships take energy (liabilities). Some are neutral (maintenance). Most people never audit their social energy portfolio, then wonder why they're constantly depleted.</p>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <p>
                            <strong>Energy Exchange</strong> is <strong>social capital management</strong>.<br>
                            It's recognizing that your attention,<br>
                            emotional capacity, and time<br>
                            are finite resources that must be<br>
                            invested strategically, not spent randomly.<br>
                            Every interaction has an ROI.<br>
                            Every relationship has a balance sheet.<br>
                            You are the portfolio manager.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The romantic notion that "relationships should be unconditional" is dangerous. All healthy relationships have conditions: mutual respect, reciprocity, shared values. Energy exchange auditing helps you identify which relationships meet these conditions and which don't.</p>

                            <p><strong>Net energy positive.</strong> These relationships leave you feeling energized, inspired, supported. They respect your boundaries, reciprocate investment, and align with your values. They're compounding investments in your well-being.</p>
